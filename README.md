# Collect accessibility score and post to slack

For this project, I used selenium to login to Siteimprove (requests or mecahnize would not work). I then extracted the accessibiliy score from the dashboard and posted it onto a slack channel using a webhook.

Make sure to run this off corporate network (or use a proxy)

Run Autorun.bat


Used for Bell's accessibility project.
