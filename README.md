# Collect accessibility score and post to slack

For this project, I used selenium to login to Siteimprove (requests or mecahnize would not work). I then extracted the accessibility score from the dashboard and posted it onto a slack channel using a webhook.

Make sure to run this off corporate network (or use a proxy)

<b> Run Autorun.bat</b>

Make sure to edit Proxy, Username, Password, and webhook fields.
